### 1.What is a Data structure ?
* Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer memory so that it can be used efficiently.

### 2. why to learn DSA ?
* 1.Raise level of Programming.
* 2.Efficient Programming.
* 3.Able to solve complex problems.
* 4.Campus Placement.
* 5.A-Grade Company placement.

### 3. What is the importance of structuring data ?
* 1.**Dictionary** -> Let suppose we have a large dictionary, and we have to find any words, then how can we find the word from dictionary, for easily finding that word we need to use DSA concept, like sorting and efficient searching.

* 2.**Map** -> Let suppose we have a map of any city and we have to go somewhere in the city in less time using shortest path using DSA concept.

### 4. Where are the data structure resides ?
* It resides in computer hardware component called **RAM**.

### 5. Classification of DS.
* 1.**Linear Data Structure** -> Array,Dynamic Array, Linked-List, Stack, Queue, Dequeue , etc.

* 2.**Non-Linear Data Structure** -> Binary Search Tree (BST), Binary Tree (B.T), Search Tree, Graph, etc

### 6. Algorithm 
* An algorithm is the step by step, natural linguistic representation of logic to solve a given problem.

### 7. Prerequisites in Python to learn DSA.
* Built-in data types
* control statements
* functions
* class and objects
* __init__()
* Types of variables and functions in class
